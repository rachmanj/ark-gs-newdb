## Project Memory Entries

### [001] ARK-GS Comprehensive System Analysis (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Analyze and document the complete ARK-GS (ARK Global System) ERP architecture and business logic for industrial operations management.

**Solution**: Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis covering 33 controllers, 14 models, 23 database migrations, and complete business workflow understanding. Documented system architecture, technology stack, data flows, and architectural decisions.

**Key Learning**: ARK-GS is a sophisticated ERP system handling procurement (POWITHETA/SAP integration), production tracking (daily production with shift management), goods receipt processing (GRPO), material management (MIGI/INCOMING), and financial management (budget tracking). System uses Laravel 8.75+ with AdminLTE, Spatie permissions, and Laravel Excel for data processing. Architecture follows MVC pattern with batch-based data imports and normalized purchase order structures.

---

### [002] Multi-Modal Data Processing Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex data import/export workflows for SAP system integration and production tracking.

**Solution**: Identified four main data processing modules: POWITHETA (PO data from SAP), GRPO (goods receipt), MIGI (material issues), INCOMING (incoming materials). Each module supports Excel import/export, batch processing, and conversion to normalized structures.

**Key Learning**: System handles both legacy SAP data (flattened structure) and modern normalized data structures. Batch processing enables data versioning and rollback capabilities. Production tracking includes shift-based operations with MTD (Month-to-Date) calculations for limestone and shalestone processing.

---

### [003] Role-Based Access Control Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding security and access control mechanisms across multiple business modules.

**Solution**: System uses Spatie Laravel Permission package with role-based access control. Users can be assigned to specific projects via project_code field. Authentication handled by Laravel Sanctum with CSRF protection and middleware-based route protection.

**Key Learning**: RBAC system supports multi-project isolation where users can only access their assigned project data. Admin functions are restricted with proper middleware protection. System maintains audit trails through user tracking in production and budget management.

---

### [004] Dashboard and Reporting Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex dashboard system with multiple views and real-time data aggregation.

**Solution**: Identified four main dashboard types: Daily (real-time operational metrics), Monthly (performance analytics), Yearly (annual trends), and Other (specialized business unit views). Dashboard system integrates Chart.js for visualizations and DataTables for dynamic data presentation.

**Key Learning**: Dashboard system provides comprehensive business intelligence with CAPEX vs Regular budget tracking, production performance metrics, and financial reporting. System supports both real-time data aggregation and historical trend analysis with export capabilities to Excel and PDF formats.

---

### [005] Yearly Dashboard Phase 1 Critical Fixes (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Multiple critical issues in yearly dashboard: incorrect breadcrumb navigation, missing project 025C from all analytics, poor mobile responsiveness, and lack of export functionality.

**Solution**: Fixed breadcrumb bug from "dashboard / monthly" to "dashboard / yearly". Added project 025C to both YearlyIndexController and YearlyHistoryController include_projects arrays. Implemented responsive design with Select2 dropdowns, loading indicators, collapsible cards, and info boxes. Created comprehensive export functionality supporting Excel, PDF, and CSV formats with backend controller methods and frontend modal interface.

**Key Learning**: Project inclusion is controlled by hardcoded arrays in controller properties - must update both current year (YearlyIndexController::$include_projects) and historical year (YearlyHistoryController::$include_projects) controllers to ensure complete data coverage. Export functionality requires separate backend routes and proper CSRF token handling for form submission.

---

### [006] ApexCharts Interactive Visualization Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Transform text-based yearly dashboard into interactive visual analytics platform with professional charts for better data comprehension and stakeholder presentations.

**Solution**: Integrated ApexCharts v3.45.1 library and created seven comprehensive chart types: (1) Budget Performance Bar Chart comparing Budget vs PO Sent, (2) Budget Distribution Donut Chart showing percentage breakdown, (3) GRPO Completion Rate Bar Chart with color-coded performance indicators, (4) GRPO Gauge Chart displaying overall completion percentage, (5) NPI Production Index Bar Chart comparing incoming/outgoing quantities, (6) NPI Scatter Chart for production flow analysis, (7) Radar Chart providing 360° multi-metric performance view. Implemented individual chart export functionality, interactive tooltips, zoom/pan capabilities, and responsive design.

**Key Learning**: Chart library initialization must occur after jQuery loads - solved by moving scripts to @section('scripts') instead of inline. Data transformation from backend requires proper JSON encoding with {!! json_encode() !!} to prevent HTML entity issues. Chart instances should be stored globally for export functionality. Indonesian number formatting requires custom tooltip formatters using toLocaleString('id-ID'). ApexCharts provides excellent out-of-box interactivity but requires careful color coding for usability (red < 80%, yellow 80-95%, green > 95% for completion rates).

---

### [007] Monthly Dashboard Project 025C Inclusion (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Project 025C was missing from monthly dashboard reports despite having valid data in the database. Same hardcoded array issue discovered in yearly dashboard also affected monthly dashboard.

**Solution**: Updated MonthlyHistoryController::$include_projects array on line 11 to include '025C'. Also updated TestController for consistency. Verified database contains valid September 2025 data for project 025C (PO Sent: IDR 594,135.97K, Budget: IDR 317,035.90K, GRPO: IDR 354,459.17K, NPI: 4,143 in / 2,583 out).

**Key Learning**: Project inclusion issue exists across multiple dashboard controllers (yearly, monthly, daily). After fixing yearly dashboard, must systematically check all dashboard-related controllers. Used grep search to identify all controllers with $include_projects arrays. Found and fixed MonthlyHistoryController and TestController. All dashboard controllers now consistently include project 025C: YearlyIndexController, YearlyHistoryController, MonthlyHistoryController, NpiController, GrpoIndexController, BudgetController, CapexController, TestController.

### [008] Monthly Dashboard UI Enhancement with Visual Performance Indicators (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Monthly dashboard tables displayed raw data without visual context, making it difficult to quickly identify performance issues, trends, or critical metrics. Tables lacked visual hierarchy and status indicators.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive visual performance indicator system across all monthly dashboard tables. Added color-coded status icons (check-circle, exclamation-triangle, times-circle), progress bars showing performance metrics with dynamic colors (green >95%, info 80-95%, warning 60-80%, danger <60%), status badges with descriptive labels (Excellent, Good, Attention, Critical), and enhanced table headers with gradient backgrounds. Created five-tier color coding system for budget performance and GRPO completion. Added contextual help with popover on NPI explaining the metric calculation. Implemented striped table styling with hover effects for better readability.

**Key Learning**: Visual indicators significantly improve data comprehension - users can instantly identify issues without reading numbers. Progress bars work best when showing percentage completion with color coding. Status badges should use descriptive text not just colors for accessibility. Tooltips provide essential context without cluttering the UI. For over-budget items (>100%), display dual progress bars (solid + striped) to show the excess amount visually. AdminLTE gradient backgrounds (bg-gradient-info, bg-gradient-warning) provide professional polish to table headers.

### [009] Monthly Dashboard Interactive ApexCharts Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Monthly dashboard lacked interactive visualizations to complement the enhanced visual indicators. Needed consistent charting approach across yearly and monthly dashboards for unified user experience.

**Solution**: Integrated ApexCharts v3.45.1 into monthly dashboard with four comprehensive chart types: (1) Budget Performance Bar Chart comparing Budget vs PO Sent for all projects, (2) Budget Distribution Donut Chart showing percentage breakdown, (3) GRPO Completion Rate Bar Chart with dynamic color coding based on completion percentage, (4) NPI Production Index Bar Chart comparing incoming/outgoing quantities. Implemented individual chart export to PNG, Indonesian number formatting in tooltips, responsive design, and proper script loading after jQuery initialization.

**Key Learning**: Reusing same charting library (ApexCharts) across different dashboards creates consistency and reduces learning curve. Monthly charts require similar but adapted configurations from yearly charts - smaller datasets mean simpler aggregations. Chart initialization timing is critical - must wait for both jQuery and ApexCharts to load before calling render methods. Export functionality works identically across dashboards when using same library. Color coordination between table indicators and charts (green=good, yellow=warning, red=critical) reinforces visual language consistency.
