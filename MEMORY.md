## Memory Maintenance Guidelines

### Structure Standards

-   Entry Format: ### [ID] [Title (YYYY-MM-DD)] ✅ STATUS
-   Required Fields: Date, Challenge/Decision, Solution, Key Learning
-   Length Limit: 3-6 lines per entry (excluding sub-bullets)
-   Status Indicators: ✅ COMPLETE, ⚠️ PARTIAL, ❌ BLOCKED

### Content Guidelines

-   Focus: Architecture decisions, critical bugs, security fixes, major technical challenges
-   Exclude: Routine features, minor bug fixes, documentation updates
-   Learning: Each entry must include actionable learning or decision rationale
-   Redundancy: Remove duplicate information, consolidate similar issues

### File Management

-   Archive Trigger: When file exceeds 500 lines or 6 months old
-   Archive Format: `memory-YYYY-MM.md` (e.g., `memory-2025-01.md`)
-   New File: Start fresh with current date and carry forward only active decisions

## Project Memory Entries

### [001] ARK-GS Comprehensive System Analysis (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Analyze and document the complete ARK-GS (ARK Global System) ERP architecture and business logic for industrial operations management.

**Solution**: Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis covering 33 controllers, 14 models, 23 database migrations, and complete business workflow understanding. Documented system architecture, technology stack, data flows, and architectural decisions.

**Key Learning**: ARK-GS is a sophisticated ERP system handling procurement (POWITHETA/SAP integration), production tracking (daily production with shift management), goods receipt processing (GRPO), material management (MIGI/INCOMING), and financial management (budget tracking). System uses Laravel 8.75+ with AdminLTE, Spatie permissions, and Laravel Excel for data processing. Architecture follows MVC pattern with batch-based data imports and normalized purchase order structures.

---

### [002] Multi-Modal Data Processing Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex data import/export workflows for SAP system integration and production tracking.

**Solution**: Identified four main data processing modules: POWITHETA (PO data from SAP), GRPO (goods receipt), MIGI (material issues), INCOMING (incoming materials). Each module supports Excel import/export, batch processing, and conversion to normalized structures.

**Key Learning**: System handles both legacy SAP data (flattened structure) and modern normalized data structures. Batch processing enables data versioning and rollback capabilities. Production tracking includes shift-based operations with MTD (Month-to-Date) calculations for limestone and shalestone processing.

---

### [003] Role-Based Access Control Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding security and access control mechanisms across multiple business modules.

**Solution**: System uses Spatie Laravel Permission package with role-based access control. Users can be assigned to specific projects via project_code field. Authentication handled by Laravel Sanctum with CSRF protection and middleware-based route protection.

**Key Learning**: RBAC system supports multi-project isolation where users can only access their assigned project data. Admin functions are restricted with proper middleware protection. System maintains audit trails through user tracking in production and budget management.

---

### [004] Dashboard and Reporting Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex dashboard system with multiple views and real-time data aggregation.

**Solution**: Identified four main dashboard types: Daily (real-time operational metrics), Monthly (performance analytics), Yearly (annual trends), and Other (specialized business unit views). Dashboard system integrates Chart.js for visualizations and DataTables for dynamic data presentation.

**Key Learning**: Dashboard system provides comprehensive business intelligence with CAPEX vs Regular budget tracking, production performance metrics, and financial reporting. System supports both real-time data aggregation and historical trend analysis with export capabilities to Excel and PDF formats.
