## Project Memory Entries

### [001] ARK-GS Comprehensive System Analysis (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Analyze and document the complete ARK-GS (ARK Global System) ERP architecture and business logic for industrial operations management.

**Solution**: Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis covering 33 controllers, 14 models, 23 database migrations, and complete business workflow understanding. Documented system architecture, technology stack, data flows, and architectural decisions.

**Key Learning**: ARK-GS is a sophisticated ERP system handling procurement (POWITHETA/SAP integration), production tracking (daily production with shift management), goods receipt processing (GRPO), material management (MIGI/INCOMING), and financial management (budget tracking). System uses Laravel 8.75+ with AdminLTE, Spatie permissions, and Laravel Excel for data processing. Architecture follows MVC pattern with batch-based data imports and normalized purchase order structures.

---

### [002] Multi-Modal Data Processing Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex data import/export workflows for SAP system integration and production tracking.

**Solution**: Identified four main data processing modules: POWITHETA (PO data from SAP), GRPO (goods receipt), MIGI (material issues), INCOMING (incoming materials). Each module supports Excel import/export, batch processing, and conversion to normalized structures.

**Key Learning**: System handles both legacy SAP data (flattened structure) and modern normalized data structures. Batch processing enables data versioning and rollback capabilities. Production tracking includes shift-based operations with MTD (Month-to-Date) calculations for limestone and shalestone processing.

---

### [003] Role-Based Access Control Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding security and access control mechanisms across multiple business modules.

**Solution**: System uses Spatie Laravel Permission package with role-based access control. Users can be assigned to specific projects via project_code field. Authentication handled by Laravel Sanctum with CSRF protection and middleware-based route protection.

**Key Learning**: RBAC system supports multi-project isolation where users can only access their assigned project data. Admin functions are restricted with proper middleware protection. System maintains audit trails through user tracking in production and budget management.

---

### [004] Dashboard and Reporting Architecture (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Understanding complex dashboard system with multiple views and real-time data aggregation.

**Solution**: Identified four main dashboard types: Daily (real-time operational metrics), Monthly (performance analytics), Yearly (annual trends), and Other (specialized business unit views). Dashboard system integrates Chart.js for visualizations and DataTables for dynamic data presentation.

**Key Learning**: Dashboard system provides comprehensive business intelligence with CAPEX vs Regular budget tracking, production performance metrics, and financial reporting. System supports both real-time data aggregation and historical trend analysis with export capabilities to Excel and PDF formats.

---

### [005] Yearly Dashboard Phase 1 Critical Fixes (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Multiple critical issues in yearly dashboard: incorrect breadcrumb navigation, missing project 025C from all analytics, poor mobile responsiveness, and lack of export functionality.

**Solution**: Fixed breadcrumb bug from "dashboard / monthly" to "dashboard / yearly". Added project 025C to both YearlyIndexController and YearlyHistoryController include_projects arrays. Implemented responsive design with Select2 dropdowns, loading indicators, collapsible cards, and info boxes. Created comprehensive export functionality supporting Excel, PDF, and CSV formats with backend controller methods and frontend modal interface.

**Key Learning**: Project inclusion is controlled by hardcoded arrays in controller properties - must update both current year (YearlyIndexController::$include_projects) and historical year (YearlyHistoryController::$include_projects) controllers to ensure complete data coverage. Export functionality requires separate backend routes and proper CSRF token handling for form submission.

---

### [006] ApexCharts Interactive Visualization Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Transform text-based yearly dashboard into interactive visual analytics platform with professional charts for better data comprehension and stakeholder presentations.

**Solution**: Integrated ApexCharts v3.45.1 library and created seven comprehensive chart types: (1) Budget Performance Bar Chart comparing Budget vs PO Sent, (2) Budget Distribution Donut Chart showing percentage breakdown, (3) GRPO Completion Rate Bar Chart with color-coded performance indicators, (4) GRPO Gauge Chart displaying overall completion percentage, (5) NPI Production Index Bar Chart comparing incoming/outgoing quantities, (6) NPI Scatter Chart for production flow analysis, (7) Radar Chart providing 360° multi-metric performance view. Implemented individual chart export functionality, interactive tooltips, zoom/pan capabilities, and responsive design.

**Key Learning**: Chart library initialization must occur after jQuery loads - solved by moving scripts to @section('scripts') instead of inline. Data transformation from backend requires proper JSON encoding with {!! json_encode() !!} to prevent HTML entity issues. Chart instances should be stored globally for export functionality. Indonesian number formatting requires custom tooltip formatters using toLocaleString('id-ID'). ApexCharts provides excellent out-of-box interactivity but requires careful color coding for usability (red < 80%, yellow 80-95%, green > 95% for completion rates).
