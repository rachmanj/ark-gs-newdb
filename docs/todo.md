### Entry Format

Each task entry must follow this format:
[status] priority: task description [context] (completed: YYYY-MM-DD)

### Context Information

Include relevant context in brackets to help with future AI-assisted coding:

-   **Files**: `[src/components/Search.tsx:45]` - specific file and line numbers
-   **Functions**: `[handleSearch(), validateInput()]` - relevant function names
-   **APIs**: `[/api/jobs/search, POST /api/profile]` - API endpoints
-   **Database**: `[job_results table, profiles.skills column]` - tables/columns
-   **Error Messages**: `["Unexpected token '<'", "404 Page Not Found"]` - exact errors
-   **Dependencies**: `[blocked by auth system, needs API key]` - blockers

### Status Options

-   `[ ]` - pending/not started
-   `[WIP]` - work in progress
-   `[blocked]` - blocked by dependency
-   `[testing]` - testing in progress
-   `[done]` - completed (add completion date)

### Priority Levels

-   `P0` - Critical (app won't work without this)
-   `P1` - Important (significantly impacts user experience)
-   `P2` - Nice to have (improvements and polish)
-   `P3` - Future (ideas for later)

## Quick Notes

**System Status**: ARK-GS is a mature ERP system with comprehensive business functionality. Key areas for improvement include performance optimization for large datasets, enhanced error handling, and potential mobile API development.

**Technical Debt**:

-   Some controllers have large methods that could be refactored (e.g., PowithetaController::convert_to_po)
-   Dashboard queries could benefit from database indexing optimization
-   Excel import operations need better progress tracking and error recovery

**Business Context**: System handles industrial operations with SAP integration, production tracking, and financial management. Users are project-based with role-based access control.
